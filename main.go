	// launches the app,  starting a loop that listens for app events and
	// executes client instructions. Since it is a blocking call, the code below
	// it will never be executed.
	//
	// On the server-side, RunWhenOnBrowser() does nothing, which allows the
	// writing of server logic without needing precompiling instructions.
